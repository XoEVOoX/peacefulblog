Let's start this *About* section with a classic... `Hello World.`

I'm a 35-year-old technology enthusiast with roots in Laurel, Maryland, and a childhood spent in the hills of rural North Carolina. My early passion for computers was ignited through console gaming. At 11, I got my first **GameShark** and was fascinated to discover I could create my own cheats. This led me to learn MIPS programming and create custom cheats for PlayStation games.

My hobby evolved into web development with communities on Freewebs, Tripod, and Geocities (remember DotTK.tk?), which in turn sparked an interest in web hacking and information security.

Although life led me down a different path, my deep-seated passion for computers, programming, and infosec has never faded. Now, I'm taking the time to earn my credentials and transition into the field I love.

### My Life
I live just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina with my wonderful, supportive partner and our three **high-energy**, diaper-wearing goblins. Our oldest is nearly three and our twins are six months old, which keeps life full and rewarding.

When I'm not with my family, I enjoy working on this site, revisiting the video games of my youth, and reading. I also occasionally participate in Capture the Flag challenges on sites like OverTheWire.org to keep my skills sharp.

### My Work
For the past ten years, I've worked as a field technician. I initially serviced, repaired, and installed automated home generators from brands like Generac, Kohler, and Briggs & Stratton up and down the East Coast. While it was a great job that I truly enjoyed, the long periods out of town were not suitable for starting a family. After that, I found a local job in Asheville, North Carolina, providing pest management services. The company culture was great, and the work was good. Over these ten years, I developed incredible social and logistical skills related to scheduling and routing, along with a strong eye for detail.
